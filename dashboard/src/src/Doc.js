            An integrated circuit or monolithic integrated circuit (also
            referred to as an IC, a chip, or a microchip) is a set of electronic
            circuits on one small flat piece (or "chip") of semiconductor
            material that is normally silicon. The integration of large numbers
            of tiny MOS transistors into a small chip results in circuits that
            are orders of magnitude smaller, faster, and less expensive than
            those constructed of discrete electronic components. The IC's mass
            production capability, reliability, and building-block approach to
            integrated circuit design has ensured the rapid adoption of
            standardized ICs in place of designs using discrete transistors. ICs
            are now used in virtually all electronic equipment and have
            revolutionized the world of electronics. Computers, mobile phones,
            and other digital home appliances are now inextricable parts of the
            structure of modern societies, made possible by the small size and
            low cost of ICs.
